# Benchmarking data-driven rainfall-runoff modeling across 54 catchments in the Yellow River Basin: Overfitting, calibration length, dry frequency

The code used in the paper for benchmarking the LSTM and CNN-LSTM on 54 Yellow River basins is provided here. Due to data distribution policy restrictions, the full training data is not available, and only sample inputs are provided here.
